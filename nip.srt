1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,470
Background Music.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,120
How is quantum Computing different.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,880
Quantum Computing builds upon the weird

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,000
behavior of quantum physics

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,640
but don't worry quantum physics is

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,560
explained in simple language in this

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,699
course

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,640
and after you complete the course

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,260
quantum physics will not appear weird

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,420
the notion of a bit is different in

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,160
Quantum computing.

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,480
A Quantum bit is not just off or on it

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,760
can be in superposition

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,100
bits are not independent of each other

16
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,840
they can be entangled

17
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,879
there is a fundamental difference in the

18
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,059
way we program quantum computers

19
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,160
it is not based on the fond human

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,899
architecture

21
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,960
one human architecture is the idea that

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,120
there is a CPU which performs

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,260
computations on data stored in memory

24
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,860
the CPU plus memory model doesn't apply

25
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,500
to quantum computers.

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,900
Quantum computers are designed like a

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,360
digital circuit with Gates

28
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,420
instead of bits the gates operate on

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,280
Quantum bits.

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,000
Quantum bits are called qubits

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,180
the qubits are not independent

32
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,640
they can be superposed and entangled

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,100
with each other

34
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,820
superposition and entanglement requires

35
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,159
us to rethink algorithms in a

36
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,759
fundamental way

37
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,799
programming quantum computers involves

38
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,180
math

39
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,720
but don't worry this course explains all

40
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,780
the required math in simple language

41
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,360
it can be understood by any software

42
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,920
professional.

43
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,579
It is enough if you know 10th grade math

44
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,680
everything you need to know is explained

45
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,219
in this course.
