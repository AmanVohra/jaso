green pigment

182
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,720
called chlorophyll it helps leaves to

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,800
capture the energy of the sunlight

184
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,120
this energy is used to prepare food from

carbon dioxide

186
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,800

occurs in the presence of sunlight

188
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,199
it is called photosynthesis so we find

189
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,160
that chlorophyll

190
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,880

photosynthesis

193
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,479
it is a unique process on the earth the

194
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,720
solar energy is captured by the leaves

195
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,639
and stored in the plant in the form of

196
